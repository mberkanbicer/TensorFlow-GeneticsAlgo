Optimize TF layers weigth with Genetics Algorithms

Gradient descending agorithm are well known for optimizing the weights of neural networks and finding the solution to converge into an optimal solution.
Usually the derivative is applied to a single output value and then the decision is gradually improved through an improvement in the optimization function (or target).

# About Genetics Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are based on the genetic process of biologically living organisms. Where in a closed environment of X species only the strongest or the best adapted to the environment survive in a new species to evolve to a new being through the genetic mixture of the survivors.
